# 👋 Welcome

I'm Wisdom Alawode, a Mathematics student and self-taught AI Software Engineer passionate about building systems that think, learn, and adapt. I'm currently exploring the intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, backend engineering, and agentic software.

I enjoy turning abstract ideas into functional tools, from intelligent agents and backend APIs to research-grade AI systems. My work is guided by curiosity, precision, and a deep desire to contribute to the open-source world.

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Autonomous AI agents (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph)
- Backend engineering with Python, FastAPI, and Supabase
- Applied mathematics in AI, optimization, and algorithm design
- Conversational systems, memory architecture, and reasoning models
- Low-code/no-code AI automation and tool orchestration

## ⚒️ What I'm Working On

- Building full-stack AI agents that automate workflows and interact like humans
- Developing backend systems to support AI-first applications
- Studying mathematical foundations for machine learning and algorithmic design
- Shipping tools and projects that demonstrate real-world AI value
- Creating educational tools to make advanced systems easier to understand

## 📈 Goals & Vision

- Build intelligent systems that solve hard problems with simplicity and elegance  
- Contribute meaningfully to the open-source AI ecosystem  
- Use math + engineering to design scalable, thoughtful infrastructure  
- Grow into impactful research or engineering roles in AI and systems development  
- Learn relentlessly, build publicly, and collaborate openly
