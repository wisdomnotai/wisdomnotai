# 👋 Welcome

I'm Wisdom Alawode, a Mathematics student and self-taught Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building systems that think, learn, and adapt. I'm currently exploring the intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, backend engineering and statistics.

I enjoy turning abstract ideas into functional tools, from building machine learning models and backend APIs to research-grade AI systems. My work is guided by curiosity, precision, and a deep desire to contribute to the open-source world.

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Data Preprocessing and Analysis with R, Python and SQL
- Machine learning and Mathematical modelling
- Backend engineering with FastAPI, and Supabase
- Applied mathematics in AI, optimization, and algorithm design
- Conversational systems, memory architecture, and reasoning models
- Low-code/no-code AI automation and tool orchestration

## ⚒️ What I'm Working On

- Data Preprocessing and Analysis 
- Developing backend systems to support and Machine Learning Models and AI-first applications
- Studying mathematical foundations for machine learning and algorithmic design
- Shipping tools and projects that demonstrate real-world AI value

## 📈 Goals & Vision

- Building low latency machine learning models for speed and optimization
- Build intelligent systems that solve hard problems with simplicity and elegance  
- Contribute meaningfully to the open-source AI ecosystem  
- Use math + engineering to design scalable, thoughtful infrastructure  
- Grow into impactful research or engineering roles in AI and systems development  
- Learn relentlessly, build publicly, and collaborate openly
